# Digital Appendix

This is the digital appendix for the thesis titled 'Galactoseismology: the Milky Way's Response to a Major Impact Event'. 
This contains code and animations used to test, model and analysis spiral arm models. 
If you would like to test potential functions, data I have collected is available in folder 'csv_files'. They are .csv files with columns Ï† and R, respectively.
For access to simulation data, contact Thorsten Tepper-Garcia at thorsten.teppergarcia@sydney.edu.au. 

## Non-code file content description:

- flatfieldanime.mp4: .mp4 of the Bland-Hawthorn & Tepper-Garcia smooth potential impact simulation with a Flat Field transformation.

- flatfieldanime_polar.mp4: .mp4 of the Bland-Hawthorn & Tepper-Garcia smooth potential impact simulation with a Flat Field transformation in polar coordinates.

- csv_files: contains .csv files of data collected labeled by time step in megayears. 

- Theory Spirals: .webm videos related to Section 4 'Theory' of the thesis. Credit: Ingo Berg: Rendering a Galaxy with the density wave theory (https://beltoforion.de/en/spiral_galaxy_renderer/)
- Model and Simulation Comparison: .png images of simulation overlaid with plots of the spiral arm models
