This is the digital appendix for the thesis titled 'Galactoseismology: the Milky Way's Response to a Major Impact Event'. 
This contains code and animations used to test, model and analysis spiral arm models. 
If you would like to test potential functions, data I have collected is available in folder ''. They are .csv files with columns $\phi$ and R, respectively.
For access to simulation data, contact Thorsten Tepper-Garcia at thorsten.teppergarcia@sydney.edu.au.
